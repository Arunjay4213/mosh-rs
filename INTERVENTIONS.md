# INTERVENTIONS

Every time the run needed outside help, was nudged after going idle, or deviated from PLAN.md.
Newest entry first.

## 2026-10-13 Phase 1 review and PLAN section 9 additions

- An independent review of commit 451b2ce arrived from the user's other machine (`reviews/2026-10-13-phase1-terminal-network.md`, 26 findings). Blocking items F1, F4, F5, F8 and F17 were already fixed in d9c8289. The remaining network items went to agent A, terminal items to agent B, and the missing impaired-transport driver to agent H.
- PLAN.md section 9 gained items 7-10 (clock base offset, errors instead of aborts on malformed authenticated input, two iterator-UB repairs, `compare` omitted from the `State` trait). Reason: the review found these deliberate differences documented only in code comments, and section 9 is the one place deviations may live.
- CI was red on d9c8289 because the GitHub runner has no upstream C++ tree. One agent is making CI build mosh 1.4.0 from source.

## 2026-10-13 Phase 0

- CLAUDE.md said the mingw linker and Windows target were installed. They were not. The Phase 0 agent installed both (`apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64`, `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`).
- PLAN section 2 lists `unicode-width` as a dependency. Replaced by a width table generated from glibc `wcwidth` so the emulator matches upstream on every character. Not a semantic deviation from upstream; it is the opposite.
- PLAN section 2 says `tests/` holds cargo integration tests. A bare directory cannot hold them, so `tests/` and `tools/` are workspace packages (`mosh-tests`, `mosh-tools`).
